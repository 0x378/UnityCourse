# Unity Basics:
For this project, I started with a tutorial from [Tech For Good](https://github.com/t4guw) on using the [WASD keys for 2D movement](https://github.com/t4guw/100-Unity-Mechanics-for-Programmers/tree/master/programs/wasd_movement_2d), and created five separate modifications to its mechanics. I played around with various physics such as acceleration, gravity, air resistance, exponential decay, and spring constants to see how well I could implement each in Unity.
